	<h4>Learning to Code</h4>
	<p>Apart from a week-long day camp at the age of twelve, I had very limited experience with web development up until this past May. While discussing my open schedule with a friend, I was directed to <u><a href="http://boomeyer.tumblr.com/post/64245504803/do-yourself-a-favor-learn-to-code-heres-how" target="_blank">this article</a></u>, which provides numerous links for learning to code. Of the resources listed, all the "Beginner" links were helpful in some way. Below are details on the sites I've used.
	<br><br><u><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">Dash</a></u> was the most helpful, providing tutorials on creating web content using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Code can be entered on the left and the page is updated in real-time on the right, so you can see what effect your changes make. I completed each of the tasks ("projects"), but can refer back to the site easily for revision or help with a certain action.
	<br><br><u><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a></u> is a full guide to coding everything from links to colours for a number of different languages. This is an excellent resource to learn the ins and outs of developing.
	<br><br><u><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a></u> is similar to Dash, where there are various tasks to complete. Although I found Dash more user-friendly, Code Academy has a much larger collection of assignments available, and I am still working through it. Code Academy includes lessons on HTML, CSS, jQueury, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.

	<h4>Creating this Website</h4>
	<p>This website was coded on <u><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a></u>, a free text editor that's great for the new developer or someone with more experience. In my case the most helpful feature is the colour-coded syntax of different tags: this makes it easier to keep track of the page and the various content, however, there are many features I haven't touched.<br><br>The full website was coded from scratch, but inspiration was drawn from the Dash projects.<p>
	<h4>About this Site</h4>
	<p>This domain was purchased through <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap.com</a>, and is hosted through Github. Many thanks goes to someone for teaching me the basics of where to code, helping me set up the website and how to push to the server. Thanks also goes to those who answered my questions and reviewed content.</p>
	<!-- <h4>Why did I learn to code?<br>June 2015</h4>
		<p>In today's technology-driven world, even though I am not looking for a developer job, the knowledge of basic coding is enormously helpful. Being able to recognize what a line will produce, and knowing how to duplicate the basic HTML, can save hours of work.</p> -->
